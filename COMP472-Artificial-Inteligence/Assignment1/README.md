## Assignment #1

All the assignment solution is in the Notebook.ipynb file\
Please don't run the notebook right away, as it was previously ran and we obtained all the other files in the directory, as well as the plots in the notebook\
If you wish to run it, it might take a few hours, so we recomend to use a smaller dataset and simply change the dataset_name variable in the first few cells.\

### Contributions
Everyone attempted the assignment on their own, and we simply combined at the end the best parts from each, thus there is no part that only one person worked on.

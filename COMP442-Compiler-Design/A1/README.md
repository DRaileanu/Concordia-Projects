# COMP442 - Compiler Design
## Assignment #1 - Lexical Analysis

Implementation of Lexer for the Moon programming language.

### Running Lexer
1. Place all .src files in ./tests/
2. Run lexdriver.jar
3. Extracted tokens will be in ./out/   with same filename as .src files, except with .outlextokens extension
4. Errors will be reported in files inside ./out  with same filename as .src files, except with .outlexerrors extension

### Building project
Project built with Eclipse using JDK-14.0.2

- Simply open projects from file system and chose root directory.
- Alternatively, create new Java project and copy all ./src/ files in source directory. Then copy ./tests/ in root directory
